# Abalone Age Prediction

This was actually my first Data Science project.
The notebook starts with an exploratory data analysis part, in which I tried to understand the different type of features and the respective distributions.

After that, I tried 4 different machine learning algorythms to see which one performed better. I firstly used the simplest of the regressions, the linear regression model. After that I used the same model but passed multiple features. Then I switched to a random forest regressor and finally I changed direction going towards a classification model, in this case I opted for a logistic regression. 

The aim of this project was to compare the behaviour of different algorithms in a visual way (Streamlit Web App) letting the user to see the outcomes when adjusting different parameters.
